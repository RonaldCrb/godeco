//! # Go diving-decompression library
//!
//! # UNDER CONSTRUCTION

//! ## DO NOT USE THIS PACKAGE UNTIL STABLE VERSION HAS BEEN RELEASED!!

//! ## IMPORTANT NOTE FROM THE AUTHOR
//! this package is under construction, it is **__NOT__** suitable for
//! usage in real dive operations neither commercial nor recreational,
//! as we need to make extensive test and audit the package reliability.
//! it is not only a matter of applying unit testing as this calculations
//! are crucial for divers safety; also regardless of the extensive tests
//! and trials in humans performed by the US Navy along the years with
//! regards of decompression sickness, it has been stated many times by
//! relevant stakeholders that these trials do not necessarily entail 100%
//! accuracy on the results of undertaking dive operations within the
//! constraints of these dive tables. there are many factors that are not
//! taken into consideration (e.g: water temperature, diver physiological
//! fitness, unadverted PFOs... to name a few).

//! This is a library created with the purpose of assisting diving
//! professionals in planning decompression procedures for air diving
//! operations as per the US Navy diving manual rev7.
//!
//! It was initially written in TypeScript and then ported to Rust to
//! harness the benefits of a much stronger type system. These safety
//! guarantees are of crucial importance when dealing with operational
//! and procedural safety in the commercial diving industry.

//! In 2021 this library was ported to Golang with the interest of creating
//! a series of bots that can distribute the access to these calculations
//! and hopefully educate the end users on the dangers of ther underwater
//! activities. it will also ease the economic calculation overhead by
//! allowing a digital actor that calculates decompression protocols with
//! no error.
//!
//! This project is and will always be 100% free and open source.
//! it is open for public review and we welcome PRs as long as they
//! adhere to international guidelines and acknowledged best practices
//! in the industry, specially those contained within the US Navy dive
//! manual which is __THE ONLY__ scientifically derived set of guidelines.
//!
//! Pull Requests based on anecdotical or empirical evidence or those
//! that could contain private parties agendas will always be dismissed
//! by the authors of this project. we do not tolerate private tables
//! and protocols that aim to distort the good practices in order to
//! increase allowed diving depth and time limits and shortened decompression
//! procedures with economical purposes.
